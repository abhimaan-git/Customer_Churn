This repository contains Customer Churn analysis project based on Telecom dataset of any company, the source of the dataset is kaggle. In this project I first figured out how to refine useful data from the whole dataset, the libraries that I used are numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib for it. The main part is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it helps us in not only finding the useful data but also how some decision making factors are related to others
